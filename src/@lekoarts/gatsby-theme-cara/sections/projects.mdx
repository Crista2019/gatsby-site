<i>IAP 2020-Spring 2020</i>
<p>In the Democracy in Africa project, our lab worked alongside MIT Professor Evan Lieberman in developing interactive, visual simulations to accompany the course material in his popular online edX course “Democracy and Development: Perspectives from Africa.” Using React, D3, boostrap, and various web tools, teams of 2 and 3 followed Agile development practices to create demos which demonstrate how games can enhance a student’s digital learning experience.</p>

<i>Fall 2019</i>
<p>"Reading Redux" was a study which emerged from round-table conversations, group readings, and data collected from student volunteers to explore what insights we glean from rereading texts. Specifically we used React and Django to implement a platform which tracks how a user’s perception of the main protagonists' races shifts throughout one's reading of the Toni Morrison experiment “Recitatif.”</p>
